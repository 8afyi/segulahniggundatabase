# Things to do!

* [x] Reference to Sefaria. Allow multiple entries for each niggun to reference a bible verse or psalm, and link each reference to Sefaria in a new window.

* [x] Be able to add records without uploading audio. When that happens, mark as "DRAFT", show to logged-in admin users only, and only make viewable to the public when audio is uploaded.

* [x] Add "Sign in with Google" to access the public view for any Google user and record their email addresses.
