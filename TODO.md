# Things to do!

* Reference to Sefaria.  Allow multiple entries for each niggun to reference a bible verse or psalm.  based on what's entered, app would go and link to that verse or psalm in sefaria, opening in a new window.  There is an npm module for sefaria.

* Be able to add records without uploading audio.  When that happens, mark as "DRAFT", show to logged-in user only.  Only make viewable to public when audio is uploaded.

* (don't do this yet) add "sign in with google" button to access the public view.  any google user should be able to access this.  we want to record their email addresses.  Look at  client_secret_765225758405-1p2ledfgrtqh2v0gnd3a6ld8p8a58u2v.apps.googleusercontent.com.json
